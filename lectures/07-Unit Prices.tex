\section*{Unit Prices}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goods which are sold by quantity are often packaged in smaller quantities and larger quantities.
\item Consumers typically have to choose which to buy.
\item Retailers are devious, they will try to trick you at every turn!
\item Consumers who shop without a calculator deserve to be cheated. (Caveat Emptor)
\item Unit prices help you see through the deception.
\item A Unit price is the price per unit of the quantity.  The calculation is quite easy:\newline
\[
    \mathrm{unit\ price} = \dfrac{\mathrm{price}}{\mathrm{quantity}}
\]
\item Discuss: is this a ratio? Why or why not?
\item Discuss: What is the unit of the result?
\item Let's go shopping to try this out!  (Interwebs, here we come!)
\end{itemize}
