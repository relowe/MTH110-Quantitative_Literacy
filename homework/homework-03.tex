\section*{Instructions}
Read the given reading assignment and then attempt the problems.  Remember, for full
credit you must attempt all problems.  You must state the problem in your own words and show every step required to arrive at the solution.  Your work should be on a separate sheet of paper.  Do not turn in this assignment sheet with your homework.

\section*{Reading Assignment}
Read the following before attempting the problems in this assignment.  
Your quiz next Wednesday will include questions to test whether you read and studied

\section*{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Jennifer, Emily, and Kelly go out to eat every Friday night.  Being best friends, they allow each other to pay what 
each can when they split the bill.  On this particular evening, 
their restaurant bill is \$65.00.  If Jennifer pays \$17.00 and Emily pays \$20.00, how much must Kelly pay to cover the bill?

\item The group of friends in the previous problem have just realized that they did not leave a tip.  Jennifer says she has a little extra cash, and so she will go back to leave it on the table.  If Jennifer wishes to leave a 20\% tip, how much money 
will she leave at the table?

\item Given the total payments from Jennifer, Emily, and Kelly, compute the ratios between each person.  That is, what is the ratio of $\mathrm{Jennifer} : \mathrm{Emily}$, $\mathrm{Emily}:\mathrm{Kelly}$, and $\mathrm{Jennifer}:\mathrm{Kelly}$.  
(Don't forget about Jennifer's tip!)

\item What percentage of the total bill in the previous problems, including tip, did each person pay?

\item If 12 gallons of wine costs \$30.00, what will 63 gallons cost?\footnote{Adapted from {\em The Progressive Higher Arithmetic} edited by Daniel Fish. 1878\label{fn:higher}}

\item If a speculator in grain gains \$26.32 by investing 
\$325.00, how much would be gained by investing
\$2,275.00?\textsuperscript{\ref{fn:higher}}

\item What is 25\% of 350?

\item What percent is 112 of 200?

\item A store purchases a sweater for \$15.00 and applies a 12\% markup.  What is the retail price of the sweater?

\item Bob has \$815.00 which is 4\% more than Chase has.  How much
money does Chase have?\textsuperscript{\ref{fn:higher}}

\item A person has \$6000.00 in the bank.  They withdrew 25\% of it,
then 30\% of the remainder, and afterword deposited 10\% of what they
had withdrawn. How much is left in the bank?\textsuperscript{\ref{fn:higher}}

\item A person owns \$8500.00 worth of property and pays a tax of \$144.50; find the rate on the dollar.\footnote{Adapted from {\em A Treatise on Arithmetic}. by J. Hamblin Smith. 1878\label{fn:treatise}}

\item An engineer engages to complete a tunnel $3\frac{3}{4}$ miles
long in 2 years and 10 months; for a year and a half, she employs 1200
workers, and finds she has only completed three eighths of her work;
how many additional workers must be hired to complete it in the
required time?\textsuperscript{\ref{fn:treatise}}

\item If 20 workers can excavate 185 cubic yards of earth in 9 hours,
how many workers could do half the work in a fifth of the
time?\textsuperscript{\ref{fn:treatise}}

\item A store is having a 50\% off sale, and you have a coupon for 50\% off your total purchase.  If the original price of your purchase is \$175.25, what is the price after applying your discounts?

\item What is the total effective rate of discount in the previous problem?

\item Five percent of the total population of a town 
enjoy hockey, while the rest incorrectly prefer to watch soccer.  If the population of the town is 65,536 people, how many soccer fans are there?

\item If a person has a salary of \$53,000.00 per year and spends 45\% of their monthly income each month, how much will they have
saved at the end of the year?

\item If Maryville College's tuition was \$50,000.00 last year and is \$53,000.00 this year, by what rate did the tuition increase?

\item Standard gold contains 11 parts pure gold out of 12.  What percent is other metals? \footnote{Adapted from {\em Arithmetic} by Jadav Chandra Chakravarti. 1925}
